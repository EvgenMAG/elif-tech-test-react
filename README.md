**Mortgage Calculator**

Mortgage Calculator - that is a fantastic Tool that will allow you to realize what a trap you will face if you take a loan. 

_This application is pretty easy and friendly. Just create a list of banks on Home Page, on this page you can edit or delay the existing bank. Then you can visit Calculator page, where you can choose the actual bank from your list and put the amount you would like to borrow and number of month you planning to pay-off the loan. The magic calculator will advise you the amount you must to pay-out per mont._

**Think twice before you allow banks to put the rope around your neck!!!**
